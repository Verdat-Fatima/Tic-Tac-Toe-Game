# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
A simple console-based Tic Tac Toe game written in C++.   Supports Windows, Linux, and macOS.
The objective of this project was to create a Tic-Tac-Toe game using Object
Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The game allows two players to take 
turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid, aiming to get three of their symbols in a row, 
either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. This project was designed to 
demonstrate the application of OOP concepts such as classes, objects, and 
methods to build a simple but functional game.
